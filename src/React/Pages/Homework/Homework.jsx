            <p>Single page app differs from traditional multipage website in a way that SPA does not involved navigating to an entirely new page, while traditional multipage website navigates to a new page. </p>
            <p>In other words, SPA pages load within the same page while traditional multipage websites do not and go to an entirely new page. </p>

        question: 'In React, what does Prop Drillng mean? Why do they say that React has a Unidirectional Data Flow? What are the pros and cons of this feature?',
        AnswerComponent: () => {
            return (
            <div>
            <p>Prop Drilling means in React is the process of getting data to parts of the React Component tree.</p>
            <p>Unidirectional data flow means that the parents component passes the state information down to its child components. The concept of this is that data has one way to be transferred to other parts of application. </p>
            <p>Pros of the unidirectional data flow is that it has less error because I have more control over my data and is easier to debug because I know what is coming from where. </p>
