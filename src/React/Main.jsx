            <p>- What are Single Page Apps (SPAs)? How do they differ from traditional multi-page Web Sites?</p>

            <p>Single page app differs from traditional multipage website in a way that SPA does not involved navigating to an entirely new page, while traditional multipage website navigates to a new page. 
<br></br>In other words, SPA pages load within the same page 
while traditional multipage websites do not and go to an entirely new page. </p>
